# BrewSnob

BrewSnob is an app I'm working on for a personal challenge at the Apple Developer Academy. It's a simple app for people who brew coffee or tea at home. It handles water : beans/tea ratios, measurement conversions, and timing. For this challenge, we were tasked with coming up with a presentation over the course of 3 weeks. 


<h3>What I Learned</h3>
<ul>
<li>How to create working SwiftUI radio buttons for iOS (they're only available on MacOS currently).</li>
<li>Using lazy V/HGrids and populate them with array data.</li>
<li>How to properly format time in seconds to show minutes, seconds.</li>
<li>Comments, comments, comments! I realized that even I may not understand my code later.</li>
<li>The importance of making sure I fully understand a bug/problem before jumping into solutions.</li>
<li>More to come!</li>
</ul>

<h3>What I'll Do Next</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use notifications to add better timer functionality.</li>
<li>Add more beverages!</li>
<li>Refactor to meet MVC protocol.</li>
<li>Add a "tips" section to give user more insight about their chosen beverage.</li>
<li>Show the user's last chosen beverage by default.</li>
<li>Add a "post brew" quiz to gather data for the "tips" section.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Versions</h2>
Version 1.0 || BrewSnob displays the suggested water:brew ratio, a timer, and allows switching from Imperial to Metric.
